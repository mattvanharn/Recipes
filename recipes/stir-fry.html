  <h2>Description</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>This is a rice noodle dish from Malaysia. It is filled with meat,
    vegetables, and noodles.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>8 ounces dried wide rice noodles</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons regular soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon shrimp paste or shrimp sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 Chinese sausages</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>4 ounces shrimp</li>
    <li>4 ounces fish cake or fish tofu, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 ounces garlic chives</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon shaoxing wine</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>6 ounces mung bean sprouts</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the dried noodles in warm water for 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a
      colander and let the excess water
      drain. If you have fresh rice noodles, cut them into 1½-inch wide strips,
      and set them aside. You can even try
      making your own rice noodles at home using Judy’s recipe for Homemade Rice
      Noodles.
    </li>
    <li>Add 2 teaspoons dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons regular soy sauce, 1
      tablespoon fish sauce, 1 teaspoon shrimp
      paste, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper, and 1
      teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Mix until
      combined, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat your wok to medium heat, and spread 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
      around the perimeter of your wok. Add the
      sliced Chinese sausages and stir-fry for 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add the 2 cloves of sliced garlic, the shrimp, and the fish tofu.
      Continue stir-frying for another 20 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>Now, turn the wok to high heat. Spread 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine around
      the perimeter of the wok.</li>
    <li>Stir-fry for another 15 seconds. Add the noodles. Gently fold them into
      the rest of the ingredients. Gather
      everything in the middle of the wok to let the sides of the wok superheat.
      Pour the sauce mixture evenly over the
      noodles, and spread another tablespoon of vegetable oil around the
      perimeter of the wok.</li>
    <li>Next, add the garlic chives. Gently mix the noodles (to minimize
      breakage) while spreading them around the
      perimeter of the wok to get that wok hay sear from the superheated sides
      of the wok. Because of the hot wok and
      the oil, the rice noodles shouldn’t stick.</li>
    <li>While the noodles are searing, work quickly to create a space at the
      bottom of the wok and add the last
      tablespoon of oil with the slightly beaten egg. Stir the egg around for 15
      seconds to cook it and break it up. You
      may want to pre-cook the egg the first time if you are more of a beginner
      cook!</li>
    <li>Next add the mung bean sprouts and gently mix everything together for 1
      minute.</li>
    <li>If your Char Kway Teow looks dry, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of water over
      the noodles while stir-frying. You can
      also add a bit more vegetable oil if you like. Serve your Char Kway teow
      with chlli garlic paste or homemade chili
      oil on the side.</li>
